            <h1>THIRTEEN WAYS OF LOOKING
                AT A TYPEFACE
            </h1>
            <p>
                By Michael Bierut
            </p>

            <p>For the first ten years of my career, I worked for Massimo Vignelli, a designer who is legendary for
                using a very limited number of typefaces. Between 1980 and 1990, most of my projects were set in five
                fonts: Helvetica (naturally), Futura, Garamond No. 3, Century Expanded, and, of course, Bodoni. For
                Massimo, this was an ideological choice, an ethical imperative. “In the new computer age,” he once
                wrote, “the proliferation of typefaces and type manipulations represents a new level of visual pollution
                threatening our culture. Out of thousands of typefaces, all we need are a few basic ones, and trash the
                rest.” <br> <br> For me, it became a time-saving device. Why spend hours choosing between Bembo, Sabon
                and
                Garamond No. 3 every time you needed a Venetian Roman? For most people — my mom, for instance — these
                were distinctions without differences. Why not just commit to Garamond No. 3 and never think about it
                again? My Catholic school education must have well prepared me for this kind of moral clarity. I
                accepted it gratefully. <br> <br>Then, after a decade, I left my first job. Suddenly I could use any
                typeface I
                wanted, and I went nuts. On one of my first projects, I used 37 different fonts on 16 pages. My wife,
                who had attended Catholic school herself, found this all too familiar. She remembered classmates who had
                switched to public school after eight years under the nuns: freed at last from demure plaid uniforms,
                they wore the shortest skirts they could find. “Jesus,” she said, looking at one of my multiple font
                demolition derbies. “You’ve become a real slut, haven’t you?” It was true. Liberated from monogamy, I
                became typographically promiscuous. I have since, I think, learned to modulate my behavior — like any
                substance abuser, I learned that binges are time-consuming, costly, and ultimately counterproductive —
                but I’ve never gone back to five-typeface sobriety. Those thousands of typefaces are still out there,
                but my recovery has required that I become more discriminating and come up with some answers to this
                seemingly simple question: why choose a particular typeface? Here are thirteen reasons.</p>

            <h2>1. Because it works. </h2>
            <p>Some typefaces are just perfect for certain things. I've specified exotic fonts for identity programs
                that work beautifully in headlines and even in text, but sooner or later you have to set that really
                tiny type at the bottom of the business reply card. This is what Franklin Gothic is for. Careful,
                though: some typefaces work too well. Frutiger has been used so much for signage programs in
                hospitals
                and airports that seeing it now makes me feel that I'm about to get diagnosed with a brain tumor or
                miss
                the 7:00 to O'Hare.</p>

            <h2>2. Because you like its history.
            </h2>
            <p>
                I’ve heard of several projects where the designer found a font that was created the same year the
                client’s organization was founded. This must give the recommendation an aura of manifest destiny that is
                positively irresistible. I haven’t had that luck yet, but still try to find the same kind of evocative
                alignment. For instance, I was never a fan of Aldo Novarese’s Eurostyle, but I came to love it while
                working on a monograph on Eero Saarinen: they both share an expressiveness peculiar to the postwar
                optimism of the 1950’s.

            <h2>3. Because you like its name.
            </h2>
            <p>
                Once I saw a project in a student portfolio that undertook the dubious challenge of redesigning the
                Tiffany's identity. I particularly disliked the font that was used, and I politely asked what it
                was.
                "Oh," came the enthusiastic response, "that's the
                best part! It's called Tiffany!" On the other hand, Bruce Mau designed Spectacle, the book he
                created
                with David Rockwell, using the typeface Rockwell. I thought this was funny.

            <h2> 4. Because of who designed it.

            </h2>
            <p>
                Once I was working on a project where the client group included some very strong-minded architects. I
                picked Cheltenham, an idiosyncratic typeface that was not only wellsuited to the project’s requirements,
                but was one of the few I know that was designed by an architect, Bertram Goodhue. Recently, I designed a
                publications program for a girls’ school. I used a typeface that was designed by a woman and named after
                another, Zuzana Licko’s Mrs. Eaves. In both cases, my clients knew that the public would be completely
                unaware of the story behind the font selection, but took some comfort in it nonetheless. I did too.

            <h2> 5. Because it was there.


            </h2>
            <p>
                Sometimes a typeface is already living on the premises when you show up, and it just seems mean to evict
                it. “We use Baskerville and Univers 65 on all our materials, but feel free to make an alternate
                suggestion.” Really? Why bother? It’s like
                one of those shows where the amateur chef is given a turnip, a bag of flour, a leg of lamb and some
                maple syrup and told to make a dish out of it. Sometimes it’s something you’ve never used before, which
                makes it even more fun.

                6. Because they made you.
            </h2>
            <p>
                And sometimes it's something you've never used before, for good reason. "We use ITC Eras on all our
                materials." "Can I make an alternate suggestion?" "No." This is when blind embossing comes in handy.

            <p>
                Whenever I want to make words look straightforward, conversational, and smart, I frequently consider
                Futura, upper and lower case. Why? Not because Paul Renner was straightforward, conversational, and
                smart, although he might have been. No, it's because 45 years ago, Helmut Krone decided to use Futura in
                Doyle Dane Bernbach's advertising for Volkswagen, and they still use it today. One warning, however:
                what reminds you of something may remind someone else of something else.

                Cyrus Highsmith's Novia is now commercially available. He originally designed it for the headlines in

            <p>
                About 10 years ago, I was asked to redesign the logo for New York magazine. Milton Glaser had based the
                logo on Bookman Swash Italic, a typeface I found unimaginably dated and ugly. But Glaser’s logo had
                replaced an earlier one by Peter Palazzo that was based on Caslon Italic. I proposed we return to
                Caslon, and distinctly remember saying, “Bookman Swash Italic is always going to look ugly.” The other
                day, I saw something in the office that really caught my eye. It was set in Bookman Swash Italic, and it
                looked great. Ugly, but great.

            <p>
                Tibor Kalman was fascinated with boring typefaces. “No, this one is too clever, this one is too
                interesting,” he kept saying when showed him the fonts I was proposing for his monograph. Anything but a
                boring typeface, he felt, got in the way of the ideas. We settled on Trade Gothic.

            </h2>
            <p>

                In design as in fashion, nothing beats bespoke tailoring. I’ve commissioned custom typefaces from
                Jonathan Hoefler and Tobias Frere-Jones and Joe Finocchiaro, and we’re currently working with Matthew
                Carter and Chester. It is the ultimate indulgence, but well worth the extra effort. Is this
                proliferation? I say bring it on.

            <p>
                Sometimes I think that Massimo Vignelli may be using too many typefaces, not too few. A true
                fundamentalist requires a monotheistic worldview: one world, one typeface. The designers at Experimental
                Jetset have made the case for Helvetica. My partner Abbott Miller had a period of life he calls "The
                Scala Years" when he used that typeface almost exclusively. When the time is right, I might make that
                kind of commitment myself.

                Princeton Architectural Press is about to publish a collection of essays I've written, many of which
                first appeared here on Design Observer. I wanted it to feel like a real book for readers — it has no
                pictures — so I asked Abbott to design it. He suggested we set each one of the 79 pieces in a different
                typeface. I loved this idea, but wasn't sure how far he'd want to go with it. "What about the one called
                'I Hate ITC Garamond?'" I asked him. "Would we set it in ITC Garamond?" He looked at me as if I was
                crazy. "Of course," he said.<br>The book is beautiful, by the way, and not the least bit slutty.

            <h1>typEm — Adapting a Typeface to Text Emotions

            </h1>
            <p>

                By Catarina Maçãs, David Palma, Artur Rebelo
            </p>

            <p>The introduction of programmatic concepts brought to typography new experiments, concepts, and the
                possibility to create generative typefaces, capable of adapting to different contexts. This work aims to
                explore these new creative possibilities in the field of type design. Through the implementation of a
                generative system, we created a typeface that adapts its shape to the sentiments expressed in a text. In
                this project, we used the emotional values of each sentence of a given text to deform the typographic
                glyphs to represent those emotional values. Additionally, and to enable the user to interact with the
                system, we implemented an application which receives a text as input and, as output, exports the input
                text composed with our generative typeface.</p>
        </div>


        <div class="quarta">
            <h2>Emotion Extraction </h2>
            <p>

                To obtain the emotions present in the text, we used an external Java library called Synesketch. The
                classification of the emotions of Synesketch is based on Paul Ekman’s research. From his studies, Ekman
                defined 6 emotions which could be expressed and detected by facial expressions. These 6 emotions can
                also be extracted from the text: happiness, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, and surprise. To do so,
                Synesketch uses a method based on the detection of keywords within the text and the application of
                heuristic rules from dictionaries based on WordNet, emotions, and common abbreviations. For every
                analysed text, Synesketch returns the weight values for the 6 emotions, the valence (positive or
                negative), and a general weight value. These weights represent the intensity of an emotion and vary
                between 0, not intense, and 1, very intense.</p>

            <h2>Typeface design workflow

            </h2>
            <p>
                To represent the text’s emotion we apply the following workflow: (i) we divide the text by sentence;
                (ii) we
                detect the emotions and valences present in the sentence with the Synesketch library; (iii) we morph the
                typographic glyphs used in each word, to represent the corresponding valence or emotion; (iv) we compose
                the
                text with the resulting glyphs; and (v) we generate a typeface which represents the general emotion
                described in the text. We opted to analyse each sentence in the text independently because the same text
                can
                express several emotions. With this, as the emotions change throughout the text, the typeface adapts and
                also changes to represent the new emotion value.

            <p>
                To comprehend how the typographic skeleton could be deformed to represent the emotions present in a
                text, we
                opted to use first the valence (positive or negative) and the general weight of the text. The valence
                takes two
                possible values, 1 for positive and 0 for negative. The general weight represents the intensity of a
                certain
                emotion or valence, ranging from 0, not very intense, to 1, very intense.
